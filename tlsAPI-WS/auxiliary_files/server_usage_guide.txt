Guide for creating mock server for mutual certificate autentication

open linux shell on your computer (we used WSL ubuntu 18.04 on ours)

AND FOLLOW THIS FOUR STEP - 

A )		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install nginx

B) 		sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

		add the following in the http brakets
		
        #indicate server
		
		
		
		server {
			# we used localhost and port 1337, change it as you see fit
			listen localhost:1337 ssl;
			server_name server;
			
			#the protocol for our implementation
			ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;

			#where the server will find its certificates
			ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/server_certs/server.crt;
			
			#where the server will find its private key
			ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/server_certs/server.key;

			#where the server should look for the client CA
			ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/client_certs/client-ca.pem;

			ssl_verify_client optional;

			#the server will verify the client!
			location / {
					if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS){
							return 403;
					}

			}
		}
		


		/*
		i recommend setting the debug flag on to see more info about the server errors
		find the "error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log" line and add "debug" at the end to get more data in the log
		*/

		save and exit ( ":wq" )

C)     /*We used our own certs and keys, change it as you want, dont forget to change the path in the conf file accordingly*/


		Enter to the folder "tlsAPI-WS\auxiliary_files\" and use the commands: 
		1) sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/server_certs
		2) sudo cp server_creds/server.key /etc/nginx/server_certs/
		3) sudo cp server_creds/server.crt /etc/nginx/server_certs/
		
		4) sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/client_certs
		5) sudo cp client-ca.pem /etc/nginx/client_certs/

D)		sudo service nginx restart

		1) if [ok] the server is up.		
		   Enter PEM pass phrase: "1234"
		
		2) if [fail] read the error.log file for more info
		   tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
